# The Day 2 Ops Working Group

## What is Day 2 Ops?
In his [blog post](http://technoblogic.io/blog/2016/09/19/day2-logging/) on the subject, Jeff Malnick describes Day 2 Ops in the following way:<br>
“It takes more to run an application in production than installing some software and starting applications. For the operator, their job truly begins on day 2—maintaining, upgrading, debugging a running cluster without downtime.<br>
"Since DC/OS is an operating system, we have the perfect platform to build the APIs and functionality required for operators to be successful and efficient at their jobs. Some of the first pieces of this functionality that we are focused on here is logging, metrics and debugging.”

## Charter
The Day 2 Operations working group is focused on topics that relate to operations: specifically logging, monitoring, and debugging to start.

## Regular Meetings
The group meets online on the first Tuesday of the month, at 10:00 PT. Meetings are open to the community. Agenda for the next meeting and recordings of previous meetings can be found in [meetings](meetings).
